Analyzed a 100 GB Global Historical Climatology Network dataset (1750â€“2024) with over 3 billion records using
Apache Spark and PySpark for distributed processing and data wrangling, enriched metadata for 125,983 weather
stations across 219 countries, and identified patterns in operations and coverage, processed daily summaries via
HDFS partitioning, optimizing task execution, and created advanced Tableau visualizations, including time-series and
global rainfall analyses, revealing key climate insights
